2.5.1 e.g., torch has only wheels, no sdists. Is called pytorch in conda-land.

LibMambaSolver has LibMambaIndexHelper.reload_local_channels() used for
conda-build, reloads all file:// indices.

If we call the solver ourselves or if we use the post-solve hook, we could
handle "metadata but not package data converted" and generate the final .conda's
at that time. While generating repodata from the METADATA files downloaded
separately.

We could generate unpacked `<base env>/pkgs/<package>/` directories at the
post-solve hook and skip the `.conda` archive. Conda should think it has already
cached the new wheel -> conda packages.

In the twine example we wind up converting two versions of a package from wheel
to conda. One of them might have conflicted with the discovered solution.

Hash of a regular Python package is something like py312hca03da5_0
